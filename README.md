# D-Flip-Flop
The D flip-flop tracks the input, making transitions with match those of the input D. The D stands for "data"; this flip-flop stores the value that is on the data line. It can be thought of as a basic memory cell. A D flip-flop can be made from a set/reset flip-flop by tying the set to the reset through an inverter.

D Flip-flops are used as a part of memory storage elements and data processors as well. D flip-flop can be built using NAND gate or with NOR gate.
